Introduction / Exegesis (500 words)

Umwelt explores how human relationships to weather and the natural world are increasingly mediated by technological systems. The term Umwelt, introduced by biologist Jakob von Uexküll, refers to the personal perceptual world unique to each organism — the specific signals it can sense, interpret, and act upon (Uexküll, 2010). For a tick, this world is defined by warmth, scent, and touch; for humans, it has historically been shaped by embodied experience. Drawing on James Bridle’s contemporary reading of this concept in Ways of Being (Bridle, 2022), the project asks what happens when our perceptual world becomes filtered through prediction, modelling, and data. Rain, once encountered as sound, air, and atmosphere, now often reaches us first as a probability or alert. This displacement frames our central question:

What is the Umwelt of a human in the age of algorithms, and can we still feel the world directly, or only through the systems that interpret it for us?

Uexküll’s Umwelt became a conceptual turning point, allowing us to understand perception as subjective, embodied, and situated rather than universal. Rain was chosen as both material and metaphor because of its sensory richness and emotional resonance. Tim Ingold’s work on perception, particularly his distinction between vision as distancing and sound as immersive (Ingold, 2011), shaped our decision to build a 360-degree, sound-led environment where rain could be re-sensitised rather than simply represented.

Our research process moved through several exploratory tangents. We examined how weather narratives are constructed by predictive technologies and how these systems increasingly define the meaning of rain before it is felt. We studied artistic precedents including Olafur Eliasson’s The Weather Project (Eliasson, 2003), Ryoji Ikeda’s test pattern (Ikeda, 2008–ongoing), Marshmallow Laser Feast’s Sanctuary of the Unseen Forest (Marshmallow Laser Feast, 2022), and the embodied qualities of ASMR rain cultures — supported by research demonstrating that textural audio can trigger physiological responses (McErlean and Banissy, 2017). We also explored umbrellas as symbolic devices, imagining them as “emitters of weather emotions” or “collectors of atmospheric feedback”.

Two major prototypes shaped our conceptual development. Network as Sensor attempted to combine NASA atmospheric data with collective emotional language drawn from online conversation (NASA, ongoing). Burst Your Bubble inflated a water-filled balloon with predictive weather data while lived, sensory descriptions deflated it. Both were generative thought experiments but ultimately too diffuse or materially fragile. Abandoning them clarified our interest in mediated perception, not spectacle.

Through iterative experiments with rain recordings, ASMR textures, sensors, and particle-based visuals, we developed the final installation. We looked briefly at emotion-recognition methods, but recognised that attempting to classify emotion from physiological data was reductive and technically unreliable. This led us to focus instead on embodied signals as expressive, rather than diagnostic. These signals feed into a secondary “living” animation that grows and changes inside the installation, reflecting presence rather than interpreting emotion.

The final installation constructs a feedback loop between human physiology and live weather data. Atmospheric conditions modulate the behaviour, density, and tone of digital rain, while participant signals subtly influence rhythm, intensity, and ambience. Rain becomes sensory again through sound fields, shifting light, and dynamic motion shaped simultaneously by weather and human response.

The project suggests that while predictive systems can distance us from natural phenomena, digital mediation can also re-attune perception. By inviting the viewer into a perceptual zone shared between human and machine, Umwelt offers a gentle way to reconnect with the emotional and atmospheric power of the natural world.
