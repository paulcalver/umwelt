Rain, Data, and the Loss of Presence

Introduction / Abstract
Umwelt explores how human relationships to weather and the natural world are increasingly mediated by technological systems. The term Umwelt, introduced by biologist Jakob von Uexküll, refers to the personal perceptual world unique to each organism, defined by the signals it can sense and respond to (Uexküll, 2010). For humans, this perceptual world has historically been shaped by direct, embodied experience. Drawing on James Bridle’s contemporary reading of Umwelt in Ways of Being (Bridle, 2022), the project asks what happens when perception becomes increasingly filtered through predictions, alerts, and models. Rain, once encountered as sound, air, and atmosphere, now often reaches us first as information. This displacement led to our central question:
What is the Umwelt of a human in the age of algorithms, and can technology be redesigned to support presence rather than distance?
Uexküll’s framework helped us centre perception as subjective and situated. Rain became both material and metaphor, chosen for its sensory richness and emotional resonance. Tim Ingold’s distinction between vision as distancing and sound as immersive (Ingold, 2011) informed our decision to build a sound-led, spatial environment where rain might be experienced rather than simply represented. This shift echoed a conceptual pivot in the project: toward mediated perception, and how machines reshape the ways we sense the world.
Our research moved through several exploratory tangents. We examined how predictive weather systems construct narratives that often precede bodily experience. We drew on artistic precedents including Olafur Eliasson’s The Weather Project (Eliasson, 2003), Ryoji Ikeda’s test pattern (Ikeda, 2008–ongoing), and Marshmallow Laser Feast’s Sanctuary of the Unseen Forest (2022), all of which transform data into sensory or atmospheric encounters. We also studied the physiological qualities of ASMR rain cultures, informed by research showing how textured audio can trigger bodily responses (McErlean and Banissy, 2017). Early experiments even included umbrellas as symbolic devices for “emitting” weather–emotion states.
Two prototypes clarified our direction. Network as Sensor attempted to merge NASA atmospheric datasets with collective emotional language, while Burst Your Bubble physically inflated a balloon using predictive weather data. Both works generated insights, yet neither addressed our emerging focus: not weather as information, but the way weather is felt and how technology mediates that feeling.
Iterative sketches with rain recordings, ASMR textures, physiological sensors, and particle-based visuals helped refine the core interaction. We briefly explored emotion-recognition models, but concluded that inferring emotion from physiological data was reductive. Instead, we turned to body-derived signals as expressive inputs, allowing movement, rhythm, and heart rate to shape the system without being read as emotional truth.
The final installation binds human physiology to live weather data. Atmospheric conditions modulate the density and behaviour of digital rain, while participant signals subtly influence rhythm, ambience, and tone. A secondary living animation reflects presence back to the viewer, offering an abstract mirror rather than a diagnostic interpretation.
The project suggests that although predictive systems can distance us from natural phenomena, digital mediation can also re-attune perception. By transforming data into atmosphere rather than information, Umwelt creates a feedback loop in which weather shapes the system and the visitor shapes it in return. In doing so, it offers a gentle way to rediscover a fuller sense of presence in an age defined by algorithms.
